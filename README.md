## **MyBatis**

MyBatis is an open-source Java persistence framework that provides an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) layer for mapping database tables to Java objects. It was originally developed as an alternative to Hibernate, which is another popular ORM framework.

MyBatis uses XML or annotations to define the SQL statements that will be executed against the database. These SQL statements are mapped to Java methods, which are defined in an interface that is associated with a specific mapper XML file.

MyBatis provides several features that make it popular among Java developers, such as:

-   Dynamic SQL generation: MyBatis can generate SQL statements dynamically based on runtime conditions, which allows for more flexible and complex queries.
-   Support for stored procedures and functions: MyBatis provides easy integration with stored procedures and functions, which are often used in enterprise applications.
-   Customizable mapping: MyBatis allows developers to customize the mapping between database tables and Java objects, which gives more control over the persistence layer.
-   Integration with Spring and other frameworks: MyBatis can be easily integrated with Spring and other popular Java frameworks, which makes it a good choice for enterprise applications.

Overall, MyBatis is a powerful and flexible persistence framework that is widely used in Java development.
